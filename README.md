# Quiz Game

Quiz Game is a simple, interactive terminal-based game that challenges players with a series of questions. It is designed to be extendable, allowing contributors to easily add new questions and features.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need Python installed on your system to run the Quiz Game. Python 3.6 or higher is recommended. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installing

To get your development environment running, clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/Bluebloodfr/Quiz_Game-LMGiraud-CDOF5.git

```


The game does not require any additional Python packages at the moment. If this changes, you would install the required packages using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

To play the game, run the following command in the terminal:

```
python main.py
